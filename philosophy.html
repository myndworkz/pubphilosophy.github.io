            <h2>A Story of Ideas Over Drinks</h2>
            <p>
                Pub Philosophy began its journey on the vibrant streets of London’s Carnaby Street, where big ideas met casual pints in a truly unique setting. Now it continues to thrive in the creative heart of East London’s Hackney and has recently crossed borders to settle in Geneva. The format is simple yet irresistible: thought-provoking discussions, great company, and the perfect atmosphere to dive deep into the questions that shape our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Geneva, Café Philosophy took off with such enthusiasm that a second meeting was inevitable. Just 100 meters from the Maison Rousseau et Littérature (MRL)—where it all started—Flanagan’s Pub now hosts Pub Philosophy sessions. And so, Pub Philosophy has returned to its roots, opening a new chapter while staying true to its original mission: to make philosophy fun, accessible, and meaningful for everyone.

            <p>
                Every great idea needs a guide, and that’s where I come in. I’m Dr. Bryn R. Williams, your café philosopher and public discussion host. My passion lies in creating spaces where anyone—whether a seasoned thinker or a curious newcomer—can contribute, explore, and connect through the shared joy of asking “Why?”
