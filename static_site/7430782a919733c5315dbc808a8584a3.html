        I have found issues with training programes not being provided for lower band staff. I contacted the training department to see if i could do a continuation of my ILM and was told that due to me being a band 3 i was not eligable for this.  (despite me having a degree in BSC hons leisure management and marketing of which i gained a 2:1) I thought this was unfair and discriminating against the lower bands. It would be good to have a fairer recruiting system where they notify you if you have been unsuccessful on an application.
