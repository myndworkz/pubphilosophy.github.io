 Hello. I am a CELTA-certified English language teacher with a background in healthcare data analysis and education. I recently transitioned from a 20-year career as a Principal Business Analyst in the NHS, where I developed expertise in educational program design, process improvement, and data-driven insights. My passion for helping others achieve their goals has led me to a new career in teaching English to adults, where I apply my skills in lesson planning, communication, and student-centered learning.
</p>

<p>
 In addition to my CELTA qualification, I hold a PhD in Philosophy, which has equipped me with strong analytical skills, including logic, statistics, and critical thinking. My previous experience includes designing and delivering educational programs that improved clinical outcomes and staff training, and I now bring that same commitment to my work as an English language teacher.
