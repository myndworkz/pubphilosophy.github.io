        Hi Bryn, 

I work as a nurse lecturer at LSBU and stumbled across your twitter account whilst doing some prep for a  forthcoming module (Politics of Health).I have a few (too many) hats here
1) I am a Link Lecturer for students nurses at GSTT, including Mark Ward! So am really interested in the 'toxic culture' and now I have to think about how I approach this.
2) As uni lecturers we don't have access to nhs  net  so free wi fi wld be really helpful for student visits and student support.  Perhaps the  Student Union at LSBU could help you with you campaign ...
3)  I have recently been treated for cancer at GSTT and have 
experienced mostly excellent care which has really reinvigorated my 
belief in the NHS and want to be supportive of GSTT, hence my concern about Mark Ward.

Good luck with your campaign ,
Amanda
