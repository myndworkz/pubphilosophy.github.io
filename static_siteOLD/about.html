 Hi, my name is Bryn Williams and my story is a twisty one. After leaving school at 17 I spend years travelling. I take various jobs in this time, mostly in pubs, bars, hotels and clubs, but also petrol stations, building sites, farms and vineyards.

 The next chapter is university, where I earn three degrees in philosophy: BA, M.Phil and PhD.

 There's a short interval where I start Pub Philosophy in London's Soho, and take it on tour to New Zealand and Australia.  It is still running weekly in London as the

 The next chapter of my career began when I turned a temporary role at Guy’s &amp; St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust into a long-term position, where I developed a variety of data applications to improve healthcare services and outcomes, reduce duplication and workloads, and support clinical research projects. Over the years, I also played a key role in supporting educational programs and training initiatives aimed at improving patient safety and clinical quality.

 I closed that chapter working as part of the Apollo team that successfully delivered the biggest and most ambitious rollout of the Epic integrated electronic health record to
 <em>
  two
 </em>
 of the largest Trusts in the UK

  simultaneously
 </em>
 .

 The next chapter starts here. After taking early retirement, I got married and relocated to Geneva, where I have embarked on a new journey as an English language teacher. With a CELTA qualification, I am excited to apply my background in education and analysis to help learners achieve their language goals.
